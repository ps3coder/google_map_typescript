## Overview
The Dynamic Mapping Application is a modern web application built using TypeScript, Parcel, and the Google Maps JavaScript API. This app integrates user-generated data with real-time mapping capabilities, providing an interactive experience for displaying locations, users, or businesses on a map.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Map Visualization**: 
  - Utilize Google Maps to render an interactive map where users can visualize locations dynamically. 
  - Users can zoom in/out, drag the map, and explore different regions seamlessly.

- **Dynamic Data Generation**: 
  - Leverage the Faker library to generate realistic dummy data for testing and development purposes. 
  - This feature allows developers to simulate a rich dataset without manual data entry, enhancing the app's usability.

- **User Markers**: 
  - Add markers on the map to represent users, locations, or businesses. 
  - Each marker is clickable, revealing detailed information through pop-up info windows, enhancing the user experience and providing context for each location.

- **TypeScript Benefits**: 
  - Built with TypeScript, the app benefits from static typing, improved code quality, and enhanced maintainability. 
  - This approach helps catch potential errors at compile time, leading to a more robust application.

- **Parcel Bundler**: 
  - Utilizes Parcel as a build tool, providing fast bundling, hot module replacement, and an efficient development workflow. 
  - Parcel simplifies the setup process, allowing developers to focus on building features without the overhead of complex configurations.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better tooling support.
- **Parcel**: For efficient bundling and development.
- **Google Maps API**: To render and manage map functionalities.
- **Faker**: To generate fake data for testing and development purposes.
